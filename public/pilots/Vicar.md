Many decades ago, the planet Ehrengard grew up on saw it's first taste of human life. His ancestors landed on this planet, decided to stay, and their descendants regressed over time. Generation by generation, they forgot their scientific history. Fragments of memories of their origin beyond the stars laid the groundwork for a primitive religion to form amongst the populace. Tales of great iron gods and flying boats powered by divinity were shared over the span of many lives; enough so to warp the ideas of technology and science into mystique and holiness. Growing to lead his congregation, Ehrengard thought he knew the inner weavings of life itself. So then, it was quite the shock when the Union showed back up and rediscovered this wayward planet. Wanting to know the truth of his life and his heritage, Ehrengard left to traverse the universe with these strangers. Now, a few years later, he seeks to continue his adventures... as a pilot!
